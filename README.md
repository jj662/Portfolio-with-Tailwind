# Portfolio-with-Tailwind
🚀 Just Completed My Portfolio Project with DevTown!

Hey everyone!
I recently completed the Tailwind CSS Bootcamp from DevTown, and I wanted to share my learning journey and project! 🌐

✅ What I built:
A personal portfolio website using only HTML and Tailwind CSS — fully responsive and includes Home, About, Projects, and Contact sections.
I even integrated screenshots and project cards using Tailwind's grid, flex, hover transitions, and form elements.

🧠 What I learned:

Tailwind utility-first CSS classes

Responsive design principles

Semantic HTML5

GitHub project structure & README writing

Smooth UI/UX practices for modern web dev

💡 Currently learning: ASP.NET Full Stack Development to power up my backend skills!

🔗 Thanks to DevTown for this amazing hands-on bootcamp! Great mentor support and well-structured content.

Let’s keep learning and building together!
