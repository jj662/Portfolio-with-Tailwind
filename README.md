# Portfolio-with-Tailwind
🚀 Just Completed My Portfolio Project with DevTown!

Hey everyone!
I recently completed the Tailwind CSS Bootcamp from DevTown, and I wanted to share my learning journey and project! 🌐

✅ What I built:
A personal portfolio website using only HTML and Tailwind CSS — fully responsive and includes Home, About, Projects, and Contact sections.
I even integrated screenshots and project cards using Tailwind's grid, flex, hover transitions, and form elements.

🔗 Thanks to DevTown for this amazing hands-on bootcamp! Great mentor support and well-structured content.
